## Overview 
<img src="images/LaLiga_Santander.png" width="100" align="right">

[La Liga](https://www.laliga.com/en-US) is the men's top professional football division of the Spanish football league system.

In this project, I collected La Liga 2020-21 season data from multiple sources, and processed them into a tree structure. A flask app is created to provide interactive data presentations.

## Code Usage
To run the app locally, download this repo to your local environment. 

### secrets.py
An API key is needed to access [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com).
Store your API key in a new file called secrets.py:
```python
x_apisports_key = '<your api-key>'
```
**For SI507 teaching team, kindly use the secrets.py which I submitted on Canvas.**
### Packages
Required packages for the project are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt):
```text
requests>=2.26.0
bs4>=0.0.1
pandas>=1.3.4
Flask>=2.0.2
beautifulsoup4>=4.10.0
plotly>=5.4.0
```
You can install the packages in the command line using:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Application
After getting secrets.py in the code folder and having all required packages installed, in the terminal, run:
```commandline
python laliga.py
```
You will see something like:
```commandline

## Data Sources
**For more details (data summary, access techniques, challenge scores etc.), please see the Project Document I submitted on Canvas.**
1. API-FOOTBALL: https://www.api-football.com/  
The API is a RESTFUL API for football data. It is used to get information of the league, teams and players. 
Methods to access and cache the data are included in [api_cache.py](api_cache.py).  
Cached files are stored under [data](data) folder:  
[teams_cache.json](data/teams_cache.json) contains information of the league and all the 20 teams.  
Players data for each team are stored in **players_cache_<team_id>.json** with corresponding team ids.  


2. 2020â€“21 La Liga Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_La_Liga  
This is the Wikipedia page for La Liga 2020-21 season. 
It is used to get information of top goal scorers and top assist in that match season.  
The data is scraped with beautifulsoup and cached using pandas. Methods are included in [scrape_cache.py](scrape_cache.py).  
Cached files are stored under [data](data) folder:  
[goalscorers.csv](data/goalscorers.csv) stores the Top goalscorers table under [Season statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_La_Liga#Season_statistics) section.  
[assists.csv](data/assists.csv) stores the Top assists table under [Season statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_La_Liga#Season_statistics) section.

## Data Structure
The data is processed into a tree structure, 
with La Liga football league as the root node, 
team nodes as the second level, and player nodes as leaves:  
```python
class LeagueNode:
    def __init__(self, id=140, name="La Liga", country="Spain",
                 logo=None, flag=None, season=2020, teams=None):
        # primary information of league
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

        # detailed league information
        self.details = {'country': country, 'logo': logo, 'flag': flag, 'season': season}

        # list of children nodes
        if teams is None:
            teams = []
        self.teams = teams

    def set_league(self, league):
        self.id = league['id']
        self.name = league['name']
        self.details['country'] = league['country']
        self.details['logo'] = league['logo']
        self.details['flag'] = league['flag']
        self.details['season'] = league['season']

    def set_child(self, team_node):
        self.teams.append(team_node)
```
```python
class TeamNode:
    def __init__(self, rank=None, id=None, name=None, logo=None,
                 played=38, win=None, draw=None, lose=None,
                 goals_for=None, goals_against=None, goalsDiff=None,
                 points=None, description=None,
                 players=None):
        # primary information of team
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

        # detailed team information
        self.details = {'rank': rank, 'logo': logo, 'played': played, 'win': win, 'draw': draw, 'lose': lose,
                        'goals_for': goals_for, 'goals_against': goals_against, 'goalsDiff': goalsDiff,
                        'points': points, 'description': description}

        # list of children nodes
        if players is None:
            players = []
        self.players = players

    def set_team(self, team):
        self.id = team['team']['id']
        self.name = team['team']['name']
        self.details['rank'] = team['rank']
        self.details['logo'] = team['team']['logo']
        self.details['played'] = team['all']['played']
        self.details['win'] = team['all']['win']
        self.details['draw'] = team['all']['draw']
        self.details['lose'] = team['all']['lose']
        self.details['goals_for'] = team['all']['goals']['for']
        self.details['goals_against'] = team['all']['goals']['against']
        self.details['goalsDiff'] = team['goalsDiff']
        self.details['points'] = team['points']
        if team['description'] is None:
            self.details['description'] = ""
        else:
            self.details['description'] = team['description']

    def set_child(self, player_node):
        self.players.append(player_node)
```
```python
class PlayerNode:
    def __init__(self, id=None, name=None, age=None, nationality=None,
                 height=None, weight=None, photo=None,
                 matches_played=0, lineups=0, minutes=0, position=None,
                 rating=None):
        # primary information of player
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

        # detailed player information
        self.details = {'age': age, 'nationality': nationality, 'height': height, 'weight': weight, 'photo': photo,
                        'matches_played': matches_played, 'lineups': lineups, 'minutes': minutes, 'position': position,
                        'rating': rating}

    def set_player(self, player):
        self.id = player['player']['id']
        self.name = player['player']['name']
        self.details['age'] = player['player']['age']
        self.details['nationality'] = player['player']['nationality']
        if player['player']['height'] is None:
            self.details['height'] = ""
        else:
            self.details['height'] = player['player']['height']
        if player['player']['weight'] is None:
            self.details['weight'] = ""
        else:
            self.details['weight'] = player['player']['weight']
        self.details['photo'] = player['player']['photo']
        self.details['matches_played'] = player['statistics'][0]['games']['appearences']
        self.details['lineups'] = player['statistics'][0]['games']['lineups']
        self.details['minutes'] = player['statistics'][0]['games']['minutes']
        self.details['position'] = player['statistics'][0]['games']['position']
        if player['statistics'][0]['games']['rating'] is None:
            self.details['rating'] = ""
        else:
            self.details['rating'] = player['statistics'][0]['games']['rating']
```
After creating the three kinds of nodes, a tree is constructed using LeagueNode as the root:
```python
def Construct_Tree(root):
    tree = {
        'NodeType': 'LeagueNode',
        'id': root.id,
        'name': root.name,
        'details': root.details,
        'children': [
            {
                'NodeType': 'TeamNode',
                'id': team.id,
                'name': team.name,
                'details': team.details,
                'children': [
                    {
                        'NodeType': 'PlayerNode',
                        'id': player.id,
                        'name': player.name,
                        'details': player.details
                    }
                    for player in team.players
                ]
            }
            for team in root.teams
        ]
    }
    with open('data/tree.json', "w") as treeFile:
        json.dump(tree, treeFile)
    return tree
```
For full codes, please see [utils.py](utils.py).  
The resulting tree is cached and stored in [tree.json](data/tree.json).  
The code that reads and caches the tree is included in [load_data.py](load_data.py)

## Interaction and Presentation Options
User interactions are based on the Flask web application.  
There are four general types of presentation options on the homepage:
![](images/homepage.jpg)  
1. Tree structure view  
If you go to Tree Structure, you will see the data structure diagram for this project.  
You can click on the triangle buttons to show/hide teams and players:
![](images/tree1.jpg)  
![](images/tree2.jpg)  
By clicking on the "see detail" buttons, you can see detailed information of the league/the corresponding team.  
![](images/league.jpg)  
![](images/team.jpg)  
By clicking on "See all players in <team_name>" button on each team detail page, a list of all the players in the team will be shown with their statistics and information.  
![](images/all_player.jpg)  
You also have the option to look at individual players by clicking on their names in the tree structure.  
![](images/player.jpg)  

2. Overall standings  
If you go to Standings, you will see a table showing the rankings of the teams and their statistics.  
![](images/standings.jpg)  
3. Top 10 goal scorers/assists  
If you go to Top Scorers/Top Assists, you will see a table showing the top 10 players in each category.  
![](images/scorer.jpg)  
![](images/assist.jpg)  
4. Visualizations of the number of players by team/nationality/position  
If you go to Visualizations, you will first be directed to an html form asking you which visualization to show.  
![](images/form.jpg)  
After you click on the submit button, you will be redirected to a page showing the visualization of your choice.
